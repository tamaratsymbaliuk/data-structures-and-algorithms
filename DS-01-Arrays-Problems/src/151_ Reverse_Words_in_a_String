Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


using trim(),split() methods:

class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces
        String[] str = s.trim().split("\\s+");

        // Initialize the output string
        String result = "";

        // Iterate through the words in reverse order
        for (int i = str.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            // Append the current word and a space to the output
            result += str[i] + " ";
        }

        // Append the first word to the output (without trailing space)
        return result + str[0];
    }
}
