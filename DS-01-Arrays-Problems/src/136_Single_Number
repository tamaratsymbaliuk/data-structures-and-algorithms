//Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears TWICE EXCEPT FOR ONE. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity (Theta (n)) and use only constant extra space(Theta(1).


class SingleNumber {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int a = 0;
        for (int i: nums){
            a = a^i;
        }
        return a;
    }
}

//We're using XOR as a bitwise operation to cancel a pair of numbers.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
